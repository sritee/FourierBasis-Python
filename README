1) Change environment if desired. Ensure you change num_actions to the available actions. This is done by checking env.action_space
2) Change base alpha and fourier order as desired by setting the variables!No other changes needed.3rd order will work well for most problems.
3) Set gamma, epsilon,zeta(bootstrapping parameter) for task appropriately
